From the Director's Desk

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am Gautam Barua, Director IIIT Guwahati (IIITG). I was the Mentor
Director from 2013-2016 and then I became a regular Director. I have ten
years' experience as Director IITG, and I was also at IITG in the
formative years (1995-1998) when the Institute was being established. I
also have experience in setting up IIT Patna as the Mentor Director (in
2008-09). So I have rich experience in setting up Institutions.

I am an IT specialist. I have been a faculty in Computer Science and
Engineering for 38 years (13 years at IIT Kanpur, 18 years at IITG, and
7 at IIITG). I am therefore also taking part in teaching at IIIT
Guwahati. You can find more about me at
<https://www.iiitg.ac.in/computer-science-and-engineering/prof-gautam-barua>.

I assure aspiring students that you will be joining an Institution which
in a few years will become a leading Institution of the country. We have
a healthy student to faculty ratio. All Asst. Professors have PhDs. More
details on the faculty are available elsewhere on this website. We
started a PhD programme in April 2015. Currently there are 39 regular
and 48 part-time PhD students in the Institute. Six students have
already completed their PhDs from the Institute. We place a lot of
emphasis on research. We have published 35 papers in Journals and 59
papers in refereed Conferences in 2019-20. Currently 18 sponsored
projects of total value of Rs. 3 crores are going on at the Institute.
Eight projects have completed. We have introduced an online mode to the
M.Tech programme in CSE and in ECE targeting mainly working
professionals. The Institute was ranked 66 among Engineering Institutes
in NIRF 2020 (the Central Govt's ranking system). We are the highest
ranked IIIT under the Central Govt.

Placement of the first four batches has been very good. For the 2019-20
season, the median annual salary offer is about Rs 5 lakhs, while the
highest domestic salary offered is Rs. 17 lakhs. Almost all the students
of the first four batches are currently employed or pursuing higher
studies. A number of students are enrolled in PhD programmes in the US.
Notable ones are one at Carnegie Mellon University (CSE), and another at
University of Texas Austin (ECE). We held our first convocation on May
15, 2018 (for two batches), the second on May 17, 2019, and the third on
December 16, 2020 (in virtual mode).

The Institute moved to its campus in July 2018. The campus is on 67
acres of land, about 4 km from the airport at Guwahati. Current
Infrastructure and Facilities: 680-seater Boys' hostel, 170-seater
Girls' Hostel, 48 faculty flats, 9200 sqm admin-cum-academic building,
NKN network, fully wi-fi enabled campus. We are expanding our hostel
facilities to cater to more students. Photos can be seen elsewhere on
this site.

Due to the pandemic, we have been conducting classes in online mode from
March 20 onwards. All examinations are being held in online, proctored
mode. We are subscribing to a Cloud based Learning Management System
(LMS) to deliver lectures and to handle class related activities.
Throughout the Pandemic period, we have kept our hostels open to those
who wish to stay on campus. This has helped all those students whose
home environment suffers from poor Internet connectivity or insufficient
provisions to attend to online classes throughout the day.
